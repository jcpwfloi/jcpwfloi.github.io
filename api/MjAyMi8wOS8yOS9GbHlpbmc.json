There are a few things one need to consider if one ever need to supercommute:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Time</strong> (point-to-point)</li>\n<li><strong>Cost</strong> (flight cost + last mile connection cost)</li>\n<li>Flight <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>frequency</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Contingency plans</strong></li>\n</ul><p>Hence, I’ll walk you through these several topics in this article:</p>\n<ul><li>Minimizing last-mile connection cost</li>\n<li>Deciding when to arrive at the airport to cut travel time</li>\n<li>Minimizing flight cost by leveraging credit card points and airline miles</li>\n<li>Same-day standby or changes (SDS or SDC) to further cut costs</li>\n<li>What if I miss a flight?</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"2022/09/29/Flying\">Read More…</a></p>\n<a id=\"more\"></a><h1 id=\"intro\">Intro<a href=\"#intro\" title=\"Intro\"></a></h1><p>Flying low-cost doesn’t necessarily mean you are flying with low-cost carriers like Frontier, Spirit, or Southwest. Often times, low-cost carriers mean they are operating with uniform plane specs and point-to-point model instead of hub-and-spoke model. We will dive into this topic later, but it is really important for you to understand flying full-service carriers like American, Delta, United, etc. doesn’t mean it’s more expensive.</p>\n<p>To ensure that we are speaking the same language, I’ll start with definitions so that you can understand all the jargons I’m talking about. To make things simpler, I redefine some terms so that I can leave out some of the details concerning other modes of transportation or simply make things shorter.</p>\n<h1 id=\"definitions\">Definitions<a href=\"#definitions\" title=\"Definitions\"></a></h1><ul><li><strong>Supercommuting</strong>: Frequent travel (at least one round-trip weekly) between point $A$ and point $B$ that are at least 5 hours apart unless you are flying.</li>\n<li><strong>Landside</strong>: Airport area before TSA security.</li>\n<li><strong>Airside</strong>: Airport area after TSA security.</li>\n<li><strong>Route</strong>: The set of all scheduled <strong>nonstop</strong> flights departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ on a specific day. When we say route $R$ has $x$ flights on Mondays this September, it means there are $x$ <strong>nonstop</strong> flights on every Monday this September departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ regardless of which carrier is flying.</li>\n<li><strong>Daily Capacity</strong>: Sum of all seats available on route $R$ on a specific day. Similarly, daily capacity of Delta means sum of all seats on all flights of route $R$ operated by Delta on a specific day.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Time between departures. If bus $A$ arrives every 30 minutes during peak hours, we say the <strong>frequency</strong> of bus $A$ is 30 minutes during peak hours. If Carrier $C$ has a route $R$ departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ every 70 to 80 minutes during rush hour, we say the <strong>frequency</strong> of route $R$ is between 70 to 80 minutes during rush hour.</li>\n</ul><h1 id=\"cut-costs\">Cut Costs<a href=\"#cut-costs\" title=\"Cut Costs\"></a></h1><h2 id=\"cheaper-last-mile-connections\">Cheaper Last-mile Connections<a href=\"#cheaper-last-mile-connections\" title=\"Cheaper Last-mile Connections\"></a></h2><p>Perhaps you may think it is more expensive flying than last-mile connections.
