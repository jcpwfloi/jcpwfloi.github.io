Supercommuting between two cities isn't easy, but it's much more manageable when I'm only doing it weekly. There are a few things one need to consider if one ever need to supercommute:

* **Time** (point-to-point)
* **Cost** (flight cost + last mile connection cost)
* Flight **capacity** and **frequency**
* **Contingency plans**

Hence, I'll walk you through these several topics in this article:

* Minimizing last-mile connection cost
* Deciding when to arrive at the airport to cut travel time
* Minimizing flight cost by leveraging credit card points and airline miles
* Same-day standby or changes (SDS or SDC) to further cut costs
* What if I miss a flight?

# Intro

Flying low-cost doesn't necessarily mean you are flying with low-cost carriers like Frontier, Spirit, or Southwest. Often times, low-cost carriers mean they are operating with uniform plane specs and point-to-point model instead of hub-and-spoke model. We will dive into this topic later, but it is really important for you to understand flying full-service carriers like American, Delta, United, etc. doesn't mean it's more expensive.

To ensure that we are speaking the same language, I'll start with definitions so that you can understand all the jargons I'm talking about. To make things simpler, I redefine some terms so that I can leave out some of the details concerning other modes of transportation or simply make things shorter.

# Definitions

- **Supercommuting**: Frequent travel (at least one round-trip weekly) between point $A$ and point $B$ that are at least 5 hours apart unless you are flying.
- **Landside**: Airport area before TSA security.
- **Airside**: Airport area after TSA security.
- **Route**: The set of all scheduled **nonstop** flights departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ on a specific day. When we say route $R$ has $x$ flights on Mondays this September, it means there are $x$ **nonstop** flights on every Monday this September departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ regardless of which carrier is flying.
- **Daily Capacity**: Sum of all seats available on route $R$ on a specific day. Similarly, daily capacity of Delta means sum of all seats on all flights of route $R$ operated by Delta on a specific day.
- **Frequency**: Time between departures. If bus $A$ arrives every 30 minutes during peak hours, we say the **frequency** of bus $A$ is 30 minutes during peak hours. If Carrier $C$ has a route $R$ departing from airport $A$ to airport $B$ every 70 to 80 minutes during rush hour, we say the **frequency** of route $R$ is between 70 to 80 minutes during rush hour.

# Cut Costs

## Cheaper Last-mile Connections

Perhaps you may think it is more expensive flying than last-mile connections. Well -- it rarely is the case.
